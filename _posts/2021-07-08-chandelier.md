Time away from poems  
Birthed seminal disrepair  
A nursery of experiences  
Waiting to be chosen  
Who will be picked first?  

Rocky trails  
Kill me with my weak ankles  
Buzzing in the tree limbs  
Branches break  

My eyes shut  
To hear breathing,  
Nature sings  
As my heart rests  

Here come the waves  
Churning the veteran sailors  
Into young men  
As they throw themselves off  
Into the ocean  

But one man stays on the boat  
He unearths a small rock  
A gift from his mother  
Smooth, grey, rigid  

The flood begins  
As the crest soars to the sky  
He releases his breath  
And never drops the rock  

How a watery foundation assuages  
A crater in the ground  
Over millenia  
A way to push our insides outward  

Together one last time  
In a house with white walls  
And no roof  
But to see the blue sky  
New furniture burns  
As the walls scream to be painted
