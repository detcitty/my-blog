> When I open my legs,  
> Does he think about the intimate act  
> Of two people becoming one?  
> Exposing myself beneath him, willfully  
> 
> He asserts himself  
> With his caring gaze  
> Dark eyes  
> Craving touch  
> Yearning for skin-to-skin contact  
> 
> When I exhale  
> And close my eyes,  
> He enters me  
> And my body sinks further into the bed  
> Unable to hold myself together  
> Heâ€™s right there  
> Guiding us, leading  
> 
> I cannot restrain or block him  
> When I abandon rationality  
> And feel the tingling sensation  
> All over my body  
> 
> I open my legs wider  
> The climax is not singular  
> For we are joined together  
> I receive and hold him  
> The feminine and masculine at peace  

Now, it's not personal anymore.
