Who is this charming guy? 
My skin tingles 
when I feel his 
Furry beard on my neck 
And his hands on my hips 
With his mouth 
Ripping across my lips 
To my chest 
Reaching my perky nipples 
That respond to his bite 
Pain and pleasure 
Just what I like 

I run my hands 
Down his strong back 
And wrap my legs around his waist 
His legs steady our slow rhythm 
Into each other 
I want to open so much more 
And let him take as much as he wants 

I feel a mole on 
his right lower back 
He's strong and tall 
He commands my body 
My back arches and he grinds into me 
My legs open wider and he goes deeper inside me 
He knows what to do 
with his mouth wrapped around my lips 
his hands on my hips 
and his cock grinding 
against my quacking hole 

When he enters, it stings 
and my muscles relax in his embrace 
He feels so good inside 
I can't think 
I just feel so good 
I haven't felt like this before 
Leaning into my feminine nature 
And letting a masculine soul 
Control me 
And let me surrender to him 
And he doesn’t take advantage 
He cares 

He’s in control 
please take control 
it feels so good 
To surrender to a powerful man 
I will do anything 
you ask me too 
Because I feel so alive 
My insides are on fire
