A nice man  
Can see my face  
And not look away  

A nice man  
Smiles and  
He doesn’t spit truth  
Into my mouth all the time  

When I meet a humble straight man,  
I’m grateful  
To be seen and heard  
Only for a little bit  

Captivated but scared of men  
An absurd way to live  
To be held back by anger and fear  
What would He do?  

Racism, sexism and homophobia  
Won’t be fixed in my lifetime  
But a kind man  
Like Him  
Knows everyone has a purpose  

I must forgive  
Even when it’s not earned  
It sucks  
Because justice is given to the  
Powerful  

But I have faith  
As small as a seed  
And I hope it grows  
Into a red spruce tree,  
A perennial and free
