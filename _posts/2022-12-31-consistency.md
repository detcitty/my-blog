My body’s rhythm doesn’t stop. My legs change the tempo set by my heart. A slow percussive step turns into a loud melody down the hall. But that’s not all I feel. There is a burning story inside my body. The story wants to be released into the world, and I cannot control the desires within my veins. The disordered thoughts want to be written down into a three-act play.  

My thoughts cannot sit still. The constant ideas run around my mind like atoms colliding into each other. When I try to stop and tame the ideas, my body resists the shackles and wiggles free of these constraints. In the end, I end up making no progress.  

I want to build pathways in my mind. The boundaries are not a prison; the structure will helps others understand me. If I shared my unfiltered and unedited thoughts with others, what makes sense to me will not make sense to others. So I must learn to shepherd the thoughts and ideas. I cannot beat these energetic ideas into submission. These little thoughts must popcorn around my 5x5 box and soon enough, a story will converge when irrelevant thoughts begin to see theirselves out of the boundary. 

The question is: how do I create this imaginary boundary and let my ideas remain free? Experimentation and consistent making. 

This is my goal for the new year.
