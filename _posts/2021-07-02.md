When I think of Jesus,  
He spoke to the marginalized:  
Women, the poor, the sick, the grieving  
But where were the gays, lesbians and everyone in between?  
Were they hiding their identity?  
Men married to lonely women  

Women married to desperate men  
Fitting in to survive  
Enduring to the end  
Because that’s what they are supposed to do?  

The dutiful husband  
Longs for the touch of a man  
A denied existence  
Builds into repressed anger  
He cast the first stone  
At the sinners  
Because of the hollow hole inside  
His heart  
He prides his commitment to the community  
But his identity dies  

The Torah says  
Man shall not lie with man, it’s an abomination  
The religious leaders preach  
Truth is truth  
Says the straight, white dude  
Perpetually speaking  
Instead of waiting for others  
To whisper  

Listening is hard for powerful men  
Seeing  
Being quiet  
The ego suffers  
But hearing others is a small act  
To recognize the humanity in all beings  

Not everything has an answer  
So please, listen
