Waiting is honorable  
Sure...  

Hurry and sit  
In the sand!  
The water is warm.   
Find me a  
Shell,  
Tethered with black blotches of oil  
Or little lifeless enzymes  
Hardened into sediment  

A duet between  
Land and sea
The edges  
Of sanity  
Churn from sand to mud  
Or water to foam.  
Creatures wading to shore  
Or humans swimming  
To their death  

Salt absorbs into the skin  
As seaweed releases   
To angry waves.  
Out by the coast  
Stands the man  
I saw yesterday  

Blonde hair like a banana  
Cheap yet bright.  
A peachy skintone  
Screams for aloe vera lotion,  
Cool relief  

His chest moves  
Up  
As his belly sinks  
Down  

Trebles of windy notes  
Glide through my ears  
As I float  
To away  

The pressure of the ocean  
Isn’t a slap to my face  
Nor a kick to my balls  
But a compressing straight jacket  

Moving makes  
Me suck in air quicker.  

When I look back  
Over my shoulder  
To the shore  
I see him  
Standing in his damp clothes  

Does he know what’s happening?  
I think he’s waiting  
For new life to begin
