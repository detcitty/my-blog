The sparks  
Fly across the moonlit sky  
The flags wiggle  
Against the cool night breeze  
But a fire  
Glows with pictures of  
Apostles, crosses and bibles  

This is not a seance  
It is a healing ceremony  
The ordained message,  
Doctrine of Discovery,  
Is burned with sage  

Rage against a message  
Of Good News  
Turned into a deep  
Mass extermination project  

And centuries later  
Fires burn churches  
As young Indigenous children  
Are unearthed from mass graves  

Oh to be healed  
The pain never ends  

Many will never understand  
But Indigenous bodies remember  
And as these children are laid to rest  
In an honored ceremony  
The reconciliation process  
Continues forever  

Who is indicted  
For such heinous crimes?  
What about the survivors of genocide?  

An unleashing of the  
Indigenous collective unconscious  
Screams this line:  
“Indigenous people are bad.  
Because of his idolatrous way, the Nobel Savage is evil.  
We need to kill the Indian 
To save mankind.”

This message is beat into all Indigenous souls  
Everywhere.  
It is a belief implanted by foreigners  
To take the land and  
Build a country in the name  
Riches, sex and power  
Masked as Divine Freedom  

This message will be burned  
And replaced with the Supreme Creator’s love  

The trauma we all carry  
Will be a wound that will  
Never perfectly heal  
Before our lesions recover  
We must use fire to burn  
White Supremacy
